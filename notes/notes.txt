This is a note ...

Richardson Maturity Model
  0 -- SOAP
  1 -- URL only, where client "knows" what it's going to get
  2 -- HTTP and URL, using standard verbs
  3 -- HATEOAS, HTTP and URL

Most "REST" API's are at level 2.  If you put "v1" or "v2" in an endpoint is a good indication that your API is at
level 2.
