Does REST matter?
- Yes

If so, why does REST matter?
- It matters because it allows us to decouple and decontextualize URLs from our code. We can make consumable urls that are meaningful to the client.

Why is it important to be RESTful?
- It makes our API portable and flexible. If something changes, our API doesn't just break, it can adapt and if it can't, fail gracefully.
